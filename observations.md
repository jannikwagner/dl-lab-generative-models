- pooling layers blur the image. especially at the beginning
  - try out stride
  - try to reduce pooling layers
  - increase channels by factor 4 befor pooling
- tanh at end of encoder squeezes values in range -1, 1 -> sampling can't handle values outside properly
    - use Identity
    - squeeze into range tanh*4
- latent space directly from conv without dense -> generation even weirder
    - probably due to spatial correlations in latent space uncaught by sampling
